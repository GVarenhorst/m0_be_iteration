# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
# I'm fairly confident with understanding, but I will practice more on fluency.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
# I had a little bit of productive struggle while trying to add quoted text with the referenced array, but I figured out the "squigly brackets" and it worked fine. Nothing that created unproductive struggle.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? 
# I feel that what I'm learning is going well, but I certainly will practice to enhance fluency and speed. 
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? 
# Mostly I want to experiment and play around with code, I feel like I just got a chest of toys to play with. I think most of the answers are online, but I can turn to others for better clarity.
